GameTime
==========

*GameTime* is a *Microsoft .Net 4.0* application that is being built in C#. It's intended purpose is to provide live scores
and updates to sports games that are being played. Scores  and game information are retreived from *http://thescore.com*

*This project is still in development*

###TODO

* Add documentation to code
* Implement image search
* Implement seamless team notifications
* ReCreate team logos and banners locally rather than downloading from thescore servers.
     * This will give me a chance to customize better anyway. 
	 * Only there for now to give me something to work with

##Under the Hood

* *Newtonsoft.Json*  to parse any json from the site
* *Microsoft.Net 4.0* to power the application

##Goals of the project

* Organize my code better
* Learn how to provide a seamless interface
* Keep logic seperate from view
* Learn how to properly use and make Unit Test
